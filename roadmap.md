# Homelab - Roadmap

This roadmap outlines my journey to create a full-blown Home Lab that spans from virtualization and container orchestration to advanced monitoring and automation.

## Foundation & Infrastructure Setup

- **Initial Equipment Integration**

  - Utilize existing desktops and Raspberry Pi clusters.
  - Organize basic network gear: router, switches, patch cords.

- **Networking & Security**

  - Configure VLANs and secure remote access channels.

- **Storage**
  - Deploy TrueNAS for centralized storage management.

## Proxmox Mastery & Virtualization

- **Proxmox Cluster**
  - Build a multi-node Proxmox cluster with High Availability (HA) for VM failover.
- **Networking**
  - Configure Proxmox networking and VLANs to support container and VM workloads.
- **Virtualized Environments**
  - Set up Ubuntu Desktop on Proxmox with GPU support.
  - Secure the lab with SSL certificates.

## Kubernetes Mastery & Container Orchestration

- **Cluster Setup**: Build a High Availability Kubernetes cluster (using Kubeadm or K3s).
- **Persistent Storage**: Implement on-prem persistent storage solutions using Longhorn or Ceph.
- **Ingress & Load Balancing**: Deploy production-grade ingress using MetalLB and Nginx.
- **Security & Policies**: Configure RBAC, Pod Security Policies, and Network Policies.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up advanced monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.
- **Resilience & Scalability**
  - Implement Kubernetes auto-scaling and self-healing mechanisms.
  - Develop Disaster Recovery (DR) and backup strategies.
- **Service Mesh & Multi-Tenancy**
  - Integrate a service mesh with Istio or Linkerd.
  - Explore multi-tenancy via virtual clusters.
- **Application Deployments**
  - Deploy stateful services: Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
  - Experiment with AI/ML workloads using NVIDIA GPU passthrough.
- **Container Registry**
  - Deploy Harbor as a private Docker registry for your apps.
- **GitOps Workflow**
  - Implement a GitOps workflow with Argo CD.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Establish a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
- **Infrastructure as Code & Automation**
  - Utilize Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
  - Leverage Ansible for configuration management and automation.

## AI/ML Workloads

( WIP )

## Equipment & Hardware Considerations

- **Networking Hardware**
  - Upgrade to a 10GbE network switch, and plan for 100GbE networking in the future.
  - Set up a hardware firewall (pfSense/OPNsense).
- **Storage & Compute Expansion**
  - Add extra SSDs for storage scalability.
  - Integrate additional devices to enhance compute resources.
- **Rack & Power**
  - Invest in a 42U rack cabinet.
  - Ensure stable power with a UPS.
- **Security & Future-Proofing**
  - Maintain robust network security with a dedicated hardware firewall.

## Final Thoughts

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as I build and expand my Home Lab. Each group can be done sequentially or parallely to create a robust, scalable, and secure environment that supports cutting-edge DevOps practices and large-scale infrastructure deployments.
