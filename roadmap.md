# Homelab Roadmap & Hardware Purchase Plan

This document outlines your journey to build a robust Home Labâ€”from foundational infrastructure through advanced orchestration and AI/ML workloadsâ€”and organizes the necessary hardware into phases. It also includes sample product links for reference.

## 1. Homelab Roadmap

### Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
- **Initial Equipment Integration**
  - [x] Utilize existing desktops and Raspberry Pi clusters.
  - [x] Organize basic network gear: router, switches, patch cords.
- **Networking & Security**
  - [x] Configure VLANs and secure remote access channels.
- **Storage**
  - [ ] Deploy TrueNAS for centralized storage management.

### Proxmox Mastery & Virtualization
- **Proxmox Cluster**
  - [x] Build a multi-node Proxmox cluster with High Availability (HA) for VM failover.
- **Networking**
  - [x] Configure Proxmox networking and VLANs to support container and VM workloads.
- **Virtualized Environments**
  - [ ] Set up Ubuntu Desktop on Proxmox with GPU support.
  - [ ] Secure the lab with SSL certificates.

### Kubernetes Mastery & Container Orchestration
- **Cluster Setup**
  - [ ] Build a High Availability Kubernetes cluster (using Kubeadm or K3s).
- **Persistent Storage**
  - [ ] Implement on-prem persistent storage solutions using Longhorn or Ceph.
- **Ingress & Load Balancing**
  - [ ] Deploy production-grade ingress using MetalLB and Nginx.
- **Security & Policies**
  - [ ] Configure RBAC, Pod Security Policies, and Network Policies.
- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - [ ] Set up advanced monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.
- **Resilience & Scalability**
  - [ ] Implement Kubernetes auto-scaling and self-healing mechanisms.
  - [ ] Develop Disaster Recovery (DR) and backup strategies.
- **Service Mesh & Multi-Tenancy**
  - [ ] Integrate a service mesh with Istio or Linkerd.
  - [ ] Explore multi-tenancy via virtual clusters.
- **Application Deployments**
  - [ ] Deploy stateful services: Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
  - [ ] Experiment with AI/ML workloads using NVIDIA GPU passthrough.
- **Container Registry & CI/CD**
  - [ ] Deploy Harbor as a private Docker registry.
  - [ ] Implement a GitOps workflow with Argo CD and a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - [ ] Utilize Terraform for provisioning and Ansible for configuration management.

### AI/ML Workloads
- *(Work in Progress as hardware scales)*

### Equipment & Hardware Considerations
- **Networking Hardware:** Upgrade to a 10GbE switch now and plan for future 100GbE networking.
- **Storage & Compute Expansion:** Add extra SSDs and compute nodes as demand grows.
- **Rack & Power:** Invest in a 42U rack cabinet and ensure stable power with a UPS.
- **Security:** Deploy a dedicated hardware firewall (pfSense/OPNsense).
