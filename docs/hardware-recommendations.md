| R730 Hybrid | $1500 | $50 | 8 months |
| Mini-PC Cluster | $2000 | $30 | 10 months |
| Recommended Mix | $1800 | $40 | 9 months |

## Final Recommendation

**For Your Specific Situation:**

1. **Keep** your Ryzen 9 7950X as primary compute
2. **Add** refurbished Dell R730 ($800) for storage/backup
3. **Buy** Minisforum UM790 Pro ($750) for travel
4. **Implement** Tailscale + Cloudflare for access
5. **Total Investment**: $1550 (much better than R740XD2 at $2500+)

This gives you:
- 200+ GB total RAM
- 80+ CPU threads
- Redundancy and portability
- 60% lower power consumption
- Better price/performance ratio
